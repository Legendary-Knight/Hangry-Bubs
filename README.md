Introduction
------------

Hangry Bubs is a strategy shooter game based off the popular game series Angry Birds. It utilizes Jbox2D as its foundation so it displays several additional test cases (accessible through a drop-down menu) and other features (ex: AABBs, contact points, etc.) on the righthand side of the screen. This game was coded as a final project for AP Comp Sci A to display our knowledge and ability at coding. 

Usage/Examples
-------------

The application must be maximized to  fit the *entirety of your screen* else the game won't function properly. Additionally, do not mess with any of the settings on the righthand side of the screen. Only touch the drop-down menu and buttons on the bottom-righthand corner of the screen. 

**Starting the Game**

To load the game, run *TestbedTest.java* and the Jbox2D Testbed application should appear on your screen.
