Introduction
------------

Hangry Bubs is a strategy shooter game based off the popular game series Angry Birds. It utilizes Jbox2D as its foundation so it displays several additional test cases (accessible through a drop-down menu) and other features (ex: AABBs, contact points, etc.) on the righthand side of the screen. This game was coded as a final project for Data Structures 1-2.

Usage/Examples
-------------

**Starting the Game**
To load the game, run *TestbedTest.java* and the Jbox2D Testbed application should appear on your screen. The application must be maximized to  fit the *entirety of your screen* else the game won't function properly.

On the upper-righthand corner of screen, there should be a drop-down menu under the text *Choose a test*. Set it to *Hangury Burbs* to access our game.
